# Decision-Tree
For the decision tree project, I first performed a Data Quality Analysis (DQA), then an exploratory 
data analysis (EDA) which includes a bit of visualization (stacked bar chart from MatPlotLib).
Then, I build a decision tree classifier model and visualized the decision tree using GraphViz, as well as evaluating the performancce.
In last step, I did an automation of performance tuning and made prediction using my trained Decision Tree Model.
